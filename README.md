# Titanic-Logistic-Regression-Project
This project uses logistic regression to predict survival on the Titanic based on features such as Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked. The model aims to find relationships between these variables and survival, with performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.
